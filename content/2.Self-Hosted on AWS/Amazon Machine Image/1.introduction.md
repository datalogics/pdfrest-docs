## Overview

The pdfRest PDF Toolkit Self-Hosted API product is provided as an Amazon Machine Image ([AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)). This AMI is a snapshot of a server configuration and is available on the AWS Marketplace. It can be used as a template to deploy your own server instance, allowing you to add our PDF processing features to your own AWS environment or build your own custom workflows that you can run on demand.
