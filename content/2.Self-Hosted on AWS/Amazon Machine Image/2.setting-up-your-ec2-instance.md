These steps assume that you have successfully launched an instance by following the steps for [Launching an EC2 instance](/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted/amazon-machine-image/launching-an-ec2-instance/).

## Tutorial

::steps
### Finding your instance in the console

![Viewing instances in the EC2 console](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step1.png)

You can view information about your instance in the EC2 Console **Instances** view. You can reach it from the EC2 Dashboard with any of these links.

### **Viewing your instance details**

Checking the box will select the instance in this view, and clicking the link will open the instance details in its own view. For this guide, weâ€™ll click the link and open the instance details in its own view.

### **Log into your instance**

![Viewing the public IPv4 DNS of your instance](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step3.png)

Look for **Public IPv4 DNS** on the Details tab. Log onto the server using this DNS address, the username ec2-user, and the keypair you selected when creating the instance.

### **Start the server**

![Docker run command](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step4.png)

The following command will start the server with the default settings:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always pdf_toolkit_self-hosted_api:latest
```

If the Docker daemon is not running, run `sudo systemctl start docker` before starting the server.

## Stopping the server

![Stopping the server](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step5.png)

Run `docker ps` to view the running container and get its randomly generated name.

`docker stop <container_name>` will stop the server.

`docker rm <container_name>` will remove the container.

## Configuring the server

![Sample server configurations](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step6.png)

To configure your server, you can add optional variables to the docker run command with the `-e` flag. Use any of the following:

- `PDFREST_SERVER_DOMAIN`: The service URL. Responses from the server will use this to generate a URL that output can be fetched with.
- `REDIRECT_ROOT_URL`: Navigating to the service URL without specifying an endpoint will redirect to this URL.
- `REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED`: Enable or disable a lifecycle policy for files processed. Use 1 for enabled or 0 for disabled. Will delete files after time specified in "Document Lifecycle Policy Delay". A lifecycle policy is recommended.
- `REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED_DELAY`: Amount of time in milliseconds until a file is removed by the lifecycle policy.
- `MAX_PROCESS_TIME`: The timeout in seconds before a file processing job is terminated.
- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`: Max file upload size in MB.

## Viewing server logs

To view server logs, run `docker container logs <container_name>`.
