Follow these instructions to **manually** set up Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for use with your self hosted stack. Note that while we provide instructions for manually setting this up, this is best deployed as part of a CloudFormation stack.

Please [contact us](https://pdfrest.com/support/) for assistance or for CloudFormation template examples.

## Steps

1. Create an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html).
2. Copy the Public DNS of the load balancer. It will be used in the steps to follow.
3. Create instance from desired AMI by following the steps in Launching an instance and Setting up an instance.
4. Create your [Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs-create-security-groups.html).
5. Create your [EFS File System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html).
6. Mount the file system on the [EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/wt1-test.html).
7. Modify the `/etc/fstab` [configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-mount-helper.html#mount-fs-auto-mount-onreboot).
8. Modify the permissions on the directory:
   :br
   ```bash
   chown ec2-user:ec2-user /mnt/efs
   chmod 777 /mnt/efs
   ```

9) When running the docker container, use -v to [bind the mounted directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) to `/opt/datalogics/public`. For example:
   ```bash
   -v /mnt/efs:/opt/datalogics/public
   ```
