## PDF Compression Levels

When you use the compression API, select the level of compression you want to apply to your PDF file in the `compression_level` setting.

We provide three standard values for compressing your PDF document:

1. `high` - Choose `high` compression to make the PDF file as small as possible. This may reduce the quality of the output. If you choose `high`, you may see a difference in the way the PDF document renders when you print it or open it in a viewing tool.
2. `medium` - A balance between `high` and `low` compression.
3. `low` - Preserve the quality of the PDF file at the expense of file size optimization.

The effect of each setting on each parameter is as follows:
