Welcome to the documentation for the pdfRest Container API, which provides developers and organizations with powerful, secure, and customizable PDF solutions. These API Tools easily integrate into any workflow or application to support bulk, batch, and automated document processing.

Built with the Adobe PDF Library, the same technology that powers Adobe Acrobat, and developed by Datalogics, globally-trusted document processing experts for over 50 years, pdfRest is the gold-standard API for high-quality PDF processing.

Additional documentation including the [Self-Hosted API Reference Guide](https://pdfrest.com/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-reference), which is fully applicable to the Container API, can be found at [here](https://docs.pdfrest.com/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-reference/).
