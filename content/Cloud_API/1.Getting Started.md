## Accessing the API

::steps

### Creating an Account

You can create a free Starter account on [pdfRest.com](https://pdfrest.com/) by clicking on the Sign Up button in the top right corner. Free Starter accounts are intended for testing and development, and are eligible for 300 free monthly API calls with restricted output. *Any* paid plan provides unrestricted output files.

### Using your API Key

After creating an account, you'll be given an API key used to authenticate REST API calls to <https://api.pdfrest.com/>. You can start using this API key in one of two ways:

### The API Lab

The [The API Lab](https://pdfrest.com/apilab/) is a purpose-built GUI interface for learning and testing the pdfRest API in a variety of languages such as Python, PHP, Java, and more. It's a web-based tool built directly into the pdfRest website that can be used with free and paid accounts.

Just by being logged into your account on the website, your API key will be automatically filled in on the API Lab interface. Select one of dozens of API endpoints in the dropdown menu, upload input documents, and watch the Code window in the top right dynamically update with fully-functional code in the language of your choice. Click Send to call the API with that code, and receive the the Response in the bottom left. Use the Download Output button at the very bottom to retrieve your output files.

The API Lab is a great tool for generating code samples that you can insert directly into your project, or use as a foundation for something much bigger!

### Call the API Programmatically

Whether you use code generated by the [The API Lab](https://pdfrest.com/apilab/), or create your own based on the [Cloud API Reference Guide](https://pdfrest.com/documentation/cloud-api/reference-guide/), your free Starter account enables you to send REST API calls from any platform.

Develop for desktop, web, and mobile applications, no- and low-code solutions such as [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Bubble.io](https://bubble.io), [Microsoft Power Automate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate), and so much more.
