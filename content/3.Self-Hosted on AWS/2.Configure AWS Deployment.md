## Configure a CloudFormation Deployment

## Configure an AMI Deployment


### Start the Docker Daemon

For this process, you will need to have already launched an instance by following the [AMI Deployment guide](/self-hosted-on-aws/deploy-on-aws/).

::steps{level=5}

##### You can view information about your instance in the EC2 Console Instances view. You can reach it from the EC2 Dashboard with any of these links.

![EC2 Instances menu](https://cms.pdfrest.com/content/images/2022/12/image2.png)

##### Checking the box will select the instance in this view, and clicking the link will open the instance details in its own view. For this guide, weâ€™ll click the link and open the instance details in its own view.

##### Look for Public IPv4 DNS on the Details tab. Log onto the server using this DNS address, the username ec2-user, and the keypair you selected when creating the instance.

##### The following command will start the server with the default settings:
```
docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always pdf_toolkit_self-hosted_api:latest
```

##### If the Docker daemon is not running, run `sudo systemctl start docker` before starting the server.

### Controlling the Container

The following commands control the Docker container:

- `docker ps` to view the running container and get its randomly generated name.

- `docker stop <container_name>` to stop the server.

- `docker rm <container_name>` to remove the container.

### Environment variables

Above, using the `docker run` command, we started the server using the default configuration. There are a number options that can be customized for the pdfRest service through its environment variables.

The following codeblock shows how to configure multiple variables when starting the container:

```
docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always \
-e REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED=1 \
-e MAX_PROCESS_TIME=1800 \
pdf_toolkit_self-hosted_api:latest
```

The following are the configurable environmental variables:

::field-group
  ::field{name="REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED" type="integer"}
  Controls whether uploaded and processed documents are deleted from the system. Set to `1` for **true** or `2` for **false**. Defaults to `1` for **true**.
  ::
  ::field{name="REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED_DELAY" type="integer"}
  Controls how long before those documents are deleted from the system in milliseconds. Requires `REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED` to be `1`. Defaults to `1800000` (30 minutes).
  ::
  ::field{name="MAX_PROCESS_TIME" type="intiger"}
  Controls how long a single document will process before timing out in seconds. Defaults to `1800` (30 minutes)
  ::
  ::field{name="MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE" type="intiger"}
  Controls the maxiumum uploaded file size in MB. Defaults to `1000`.
  ::
  ::field{name="INPUT_KEY" type="string"}
  A value appended to all input file `id` UUIDs to visually and programatically identify them. Defaults to `1`.
  ::
  ::field{name="OUTPUT_KEY" type="string"}
  A value appended to all output file `id` UUIDs to visually and programatically identify them. Defaults to `2`.
  ::
  ::field{name="REDIRECT_ROOT_URL" type="string"}
  Controls the url that users will be redirected to if they try to manually navigate to the server domain. Defaults to `https://pdfrest.com`.
  ::
  ::field{name="PDFREST_SERVER_DOMAIN" type="boolean"}
  Controls which domain the pdfRest API will tell users to retrieve their files from after processing. Must be set to the scheme and host of the actual server
  ::
  ::field{name="PDFREST_MAX_CLU_CONCURRENCY" type="integer"}
  Sets the maximum number of concurrent processing requests that can run; any additional requests will enter the local queue. This prevents performance issues during batches of simultaneous requests. The default is the number of CPU cores minus 1, with a minimum of 1.
  <br><br> ex. An instance with 4 CPU cores would default to `PDFREST_MAX_CLU_CONCURRENCY` = `3`
