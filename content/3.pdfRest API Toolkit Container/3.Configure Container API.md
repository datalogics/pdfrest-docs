## Environment variables

The pdfRest API Toolkit Container is highly configurable using environment variables. These control a variety of features, such as maximum file upload size or CPU concurrency. The list of environment variables and their functions are below:

::field-group
  :::field{name="LICENSE_KEY" type="string"}
  Required field for license-managed versions of the API Toolkit Container only. Does not apply to the Toolkit on AWS. Trial license keys and further information can be obtained by reaching out to sales@datalogics.com.
  :::
  :::field{name="REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED" type="integer"}
  Controls whether uploaded and processed documents are deleted from the system. Set to `1` for **true** or `2` for **false**. Defaults to `1` for **true**.
  :::

  :::field{name="REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED_DELAY" type="integer"}
  Controls how long before those documents are deleted from the system in milliseconds. Requires `REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED` to be `1`. Defaults to `1800000` (30 minutes).
  :::

  :::field{name="MAX_PROCESS_TIME" type="intiger"}
  Controls how long a single document will process before timing out in seconds. Defaults to `1800` (30 minutes)
  :::

  :::field{name="MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE" type="intiger"}
  Controls the maxiumum uploaded file size in MB. Defaults to `1000`.
  :::

  :::field{name="INPUT_KEY" type="string"}
  A value appended to all input file `id` UUIDs to visually and programatically identify them. Defaults to `1`.
  :::

  :::field{name="OUTPUT_KEY" type="string"}
  A value appended to all output file `id` UUIDs to visually and programatically identify them. Defaults to `2`.
  :::

  :::field{name="REDIRECT_ROOT_URL" type="string"}
  Controls the url that users will be redirected to if they try to manually navigate to the server domain. Defaults to `https://pdfrest.com`.
  :::

  :::field{name="PDFREST_SERVER_DOMAIN" type="boolean"}
  Controls which domain the pdfRest API will tell users to retrieve their files from after processing. Must be set to the scheme and host of the actual server
  :::

  :::field{name="PDFREST_MAX_CLU_CONCURRENCY" type="integer"}
  Sets the maximum number of concurrent processing requests that can run; any additional requests will enter the local queue. This prevents performance issues during batches of simultaneous requests. The default is the number of CPU cores minus 1, with a minimum of 1. :br:br ex. An instance with 4 CPU cores would default to `PDFREST_MAX_CLU_CONCURRENCY` = `3`

### Setting variables in Docker

In docker these variables can be set under:

`services > **pdfrest_service** > env`

```bash
services:
  pdfrest-toolkit:
    platform: linux/amd64
    image: <image_name>
    restart: always
    environment:
      - PDFREST_SERVER_DOMAIN=https://api.pdfrest.com
      - MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=1000
```

### Setting variables in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes they can be set under:

`spec > template > spec > containers > **pdfrest_container** > env`

```bash
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: pdfrest
          image: <image_name>
          env:
            - name: PDFREST_SERVER_DOMAIN
              value: https://api.pdfrest.com
            - name: REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED
              value: false
```

## Installing msCoreFonts

Microsoft Core Fonts are not licensed to be distributed with pdfRest API products but they are freely available from [SourceForge](https://mscorefonts2.sourceforge.net) for you to install. These are optional when deploying the pdfRest API and enable the following features:

- Support maximum file size reduction with Compress PDF by enabling font subsetting
  - Subsetting the fonts that are embedded in the document is an important step to reduce PDF file size. The subset of the font contains only those font characters actually used in the PDF document.
- Support font embedding, a required step to Convert to PDF/A
  - Embedding fonts in your output PDF document ensures that the document can be opened and viewed on any machine, because the fonts travel with that document. Quite literally, the necessary font files are saved within that PDF file. This is required for all PDF/A specifications to support long-term preservation.
- Expand the set of supported fonts that may be used with Watermark PDF and Add to PDF's `/pdf-with-added-text` endpoint
  - Once installed, `msCoreFonts` are available for use with the Watermark PDF and Add to PDF API Tools, expanding the set of fonts that can be applied.

If you receive either of the follow error messages in the container logs, then `msCoreFonts` is not included with your deployment.

```
Microsoft Core Fonts not found
Setting font subsetting to false
```

There are multiple ways to configure `msCoreFonts` on a container deployment:

::steps{level="3"}

### Updating the Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile to build a new pdfRest image which include the following lines:

```bash
FROM pdfrest_api_toolkit:latest
RUN dnf -y install curl cabextract fontconfig \
        && dnf -y install https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-installer-2.6-1.noarch.rpm \
        && fc-cache -f \
        && dnf clean all \
        && rm -rf /var/cache/dnf
```

Then add the fonts in a new layer using the `docker build` command:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t pdfrest_api_toolkit:latest-msfonts .
```

### Create a new Layer for `msCoreFonts`

Run a container from the existing image. Install the fonts in a new layer to that temporary container. Then commit the changes to a new tag.

```bash
docker create --platform linux/amd64 --name msfonts pdfrest_api_toolkit:latest
docker start msfonts
docker exec -u 0 msfonts sh -lc 'dnf -y install curl cabextract fontconfig && rpm -i https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-installer-2.6-1.noarch.rpm && fc-cache -f && dnf clean all && rm -rf /var/cache/dnf'
docker commit msfonts pdfrest_api_toolkit:latest-msfonts
docker rm -f msfonts
```

### Installing via `dnf`

These commands should be programmed to run inside of the container on container start, or configured as a new layer on top of the existing one.

```bash
dnf install -y curl cabextract xorg-x11-font-utils fontconfig \
&& rpm -i https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-installer-2.6-1.noarch.rpm
```
