## Updating a CloudFormation Deployment

Self-Hosted API products deployed via CloudFormation are configured during [Stack creation](https://docs.pdfrest.com/self-hosted-api-on-aws/deploy-on-aws/#the-cloudformation-console). If you would like to change the configuration of an existing deployment, follow the instructions below. 

To update an existing Self-Hosted API on AWS deployment:

::steps{level=6}
###### The AWS console

Go to [CloudFormation Stacks](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home/stacks) section of the AWS console.

###### Enter the stack update menu

Identify the correct Stack and click "Update".

###### Use the existing template
On the "Prepare Template" menu, use the existing template. This should be selected by default.

###### Parameters and environment variables

The 'Specify stack details' page is where you will be presented with all of the `Required` and `Optional` parameters. Refer to the [Environment Variables](/self-hosted-api-on-aws/configure-aws-deployment#environment-variables) section further down this page. Update any parameter values as necessary.

###### Submit update

After you have made the necessary changes to the Stack configuration, click Submit. The CloudFormation deployment will begin to rebuild the Stack with the new paramter values.

::



After submitting the build request, you will be taken to the CloudFormation Stacks page. There you will see the status of your Stack. It will likely be `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`.

Click on the Stack name for additional information.
When the Self-Hosted API is finished updating, the Stack status will be `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.


::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
  Further information about updating existing CloudFormation Stacks can be found in the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-direct.html).

## Configure an AMI Deployment


### Start the Docker Daemon

For this process, you will need to have already launched an instance by following the [AMI Deployment guide](/self-hosted-api-on-aws/deploy-on-aws/).

::steps{level=5}

##### Find your EC2 instance in the AWS Console
You can view information about your instance in the EC2 Console Instances view. You can reach it from the EC2 Dashboard with any of these links.

![EC2 Instances menu](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step1.png/)

##### View your Instance details

Checking the box will select the instance in this view, and clicking the link will open the instance details in its own view. For this guide, weâ€™ll click the link and open the instance details in its own view.

![Highlighted instance ID in Instances view](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step2.png/)

##### Log into your Instance

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
  AWS has extensive guides on connecting to EC2 instances from a variety of Operating Systems available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect.html).
::

![Viewing the public IPv4 DNS of your instance](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step3.png)

Look for Public IPv4 DNS on the Details tab. Log onto the server using that URL, the username `ec2-user`, and the keypair you selected when creating the instance.

##### Starting the Docker server

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
Official Docker documentation is located [here](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/)
::

The following commands will start the Docker server with the default settings. Be sure to pick the command below that matches your Self-Hosted API product.
<br>
::tabs{variant="card"}
  ```bash [PDF Toolkit]
# Run the Docker container.
# -d (--detach) runs the container in the background.
# -p (--publish) binds port 3000 of the Container to port 80 of the server.
# --restart sets policy to automatically restarts the Container if it stops.
# :latest runs the most recent version of the Container available.

docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always pdf_toolkit_self-hosted_api:latest
  ```
  ```bash [PDF Forms Pro]
  # Run the Docker container.
# -d (--detach) runs the container in the background.
# -p (--publish) binds port 3000 of the Container to port 80 of the server.
# --restart sets policy to automatically restarts the Container if it stops.
# :latest runs the most recent version of the Container available.

docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always pdf_forms_pro_self-hosted_api:latest
  ```
  ```bash [PDF to Office]
# Run the Docker container.
# -d (--detach) runs the container in the background.
# -p (--publish) binds port 3000 of the Container to port 80 of the server.
# --restart sets policy to automatically restarts the Container if it stops.
# :latest runs the most recent version of the Container available.

docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always pdf_office_pro_self-hosted_api:latest
  ```
::


If you receive an error that the Docker daemon is not running, execute this command first:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```


::

### Controlling the Container

The following commands control the Docker container:

```bash
# View the running container and retrieve it's randomly generated name.
docker ps

# Stop the Docker server.
docker stop <container_name>

# Remove the container.
docker rm <container_name>
```

![Docker commands run in a terminal](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/setting-up-your-ec2-instance/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-setup-instance-step5.png/)


### Environment variables

Above, using the `docker run` command, we started the server using the default configuration. As shown below, there are a number options that can be customized for the pdfRest service through its environment variables. Invoke environment variables by using `-e` with the `docker run` command.

::field-group
  ::field{name="REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED" type="integer"}
  Controls whether uploaded and processed documents are deleted from the system. Set to `1` for **true** or `2` for **false**. Defaults to `1` for **true**.
  ::
  ::field{name="REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED_DELAY" type="integer"}
  Controls how long before those documents are deleted from the system in milliseconds. Requires `REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED` to be `1`. Defaults to `1800000` (30 minutes).
  ::
  ::field{name="MAX_PROCESS_TIME" type="intiger"}
  Controls how long a single document will process before timing out in seconds. Defaults to `1800` (30 minutes)
  ::
  ::field{name="MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE" type="intiger"}
  Controls the maxiumum uploaded file size in MB. Defaults to `1000`.
  ::
  ::field{name="INPUT_KEY" type="string"}
  A value appended to all input file `id` UUIDs to visually and programatically identify them. Defaults to `1`.
  ::
  ::field{name="OUTPUT_KEY" type="string"}
  A value appended to all output file `id` UUIDs to visually and programatically identify them. Defaults to `2`.
  ::
  ::field{name="REDIRECT_ROOT_URL" type="string"}
  Controls the url that users will be redirected to if they try to manually navigate to the server domain. Defaults to `https://pdfrest.com`.
  ::
  ::field{name="PDFREST_SERVER_DOMAIN" type="boolean"}
  Controls which domain the pdfRest API will tell users to retrieve their files from after processing. Must be set to the scheme and host of the actual server
  ::
  ::field{name="PDFREST_MAX_CLU_CONCURRENCY" type="integer"}
  Sets the maximum number of concurrent processing requests that can run; any additional requests will enter the local queue. This prevents performance issues during batches of simultaneous requests. The default is the number of CPU cores minus 1, with a minimum of 1.
  <br><br> ex. An instance with 4 CPU cores would default to `PDFREST_MAX_CLU_CONCURRENCY` = `3`
::


#### Examples for starting server with customized configurations

```bash
# Run the pdfRest Self-Hosted API server so that processed documents
# are deleted in 30 minutes. Files are permitted to process for
# a maximum of 60 minutes.

docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always \
-e REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED=1 \
-e MAX_PROCESS_TIME=3600 \
pdf_toolkit_self-hosted_api:latest
```

```bash
# Run the Forms Pro API so that processed documents are not deleted
# and the maximum uploaded file size is 10MB.

docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always \
-e REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED=0 \
-e MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=10 \
pdf_forms_pro_self-hosted_api:latest
```


## Installing msCoreFonts

Microsoft Core Fonts are not licensed to be distributed with pdfRest API products but they are freely available from [SourceForge](https://mscorefonts2.sourceforge.net) for you to install. These are optional when deploying the pdfRest API and enable the following features:

- Support maximum file size reduction with Compress PDF by enabling font subsetting
  - Subsetting the fonts that are embedded in the document is an important step to reduce PDF file size. The subset of the font contains only those font characters actually used in the PDF document.
- Support font embedding, a required step to Convert to PDF/A
  - Embedding fonts in your output PDF document ensures that the document can be opened and viewed on any machine, because the fonts travel with that document. Quite literally, the necessary font files are saved within that PDF file. This is required for all PDF/A specifications to support long-term preservation.
- Expand the set of supported fonts that may be used with Watermark PDF.
  - Once installed, `msCoreFonts` are available for use with the Watermark PDF API Tool, expanding the set of fonts that can be applied with a text-based watermark.

#### Installing `msCoreFonts`

These steps will help you install the standard set of fonts provided by Microsoft, known as the Microsoft core fonts.

::steps{level=5}
##### Installing the fonts

Inside of the Docker container, run the following command to download and install the `mscorefonts2` package from SourceForge.

```bash
sudo rpm -i https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-installer-2.6-1.noarch.rpm
```

##### Configure the container

Inside of the docker container, edit `/opt/datalogics/pdf-utility/config/settings.js` and update `msCoreFontsInstalled` to `true`.

![Configuring the container to use MSCoreFonts](/pdf-toolkit-instructions/mscorefonts-setup/pdf-toolkit-self-hosted-mscorefonts-setup2.png)

##### Apply the settings

While in the `/opt/datalogics/pdf-utility/config/` directory, run the following command to apply the settings.

```bash
sudo node apply_settings.js
```

## Manually Create an Elastic File System

An Elastic File System is an optional infrastructure component. If you have two or more pdfRest Self-Hosted API products or instances and require any of the following, you will need to configure an EFS:

- Shared document storage between instances
- The ability to chain API calls between different products, such sending a document from PDF Toolkit to PDF Forms Pro.
- Most scenarios where instances are behind a Load Balancer

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
The CloudFormation deployment option automates the provisioning of an EFS and automatically connects instances to it.
::

Follow these instructions to manually set up an EFS for use with your Self-Hosted API. Please [contact us](https://pdfrest.com/support/) for any assistance with Self-Hosted configuration.


1. Create an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html).
2. Copy the Public DNS of the Load Balancer. It will be used in future steps.
3. Create instances of any pdfRest Self-Hosted API products using the [AMI deployment guide](/self-hosted-api-on-aws/deploy-on-aws/#amazon-machine-image-ami).
4. Create your [Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs-create-security-groups.html).
5. Create your [Elastic File System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html).
6. Mount the EFS on the [EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/wt1-test.html).
7. Modify the `/etc/fstab` [configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-mount-helper.html#mount-fs-auto-mount-onreboot).
8. Modify the permissions on the directory:
   :br
   ```bash
   chown ec2-user:ec2-user /mnt/efs
   chmod 777 /mnt/efs
   ```

9) When executing `docker run` (as explained [here](/self-hosted-api-on-aws/configure-aws-deployment/)), use `-v` to [bind the mounted directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) to `/opt/datalogics/public`. For example:

```bash
# Run the pdfRest Self-Hosted API server so that processed documents
# are deleted in 30 minutes. Files are permitted to process for
# a maximum of 60 minutes.
# Mount the EFS volume to /opt/datalogics/public.

docker run -d -p 80:3000 --restart always \
-e REMOVE_ORIGINAL_PROCESSED=1 \
-e MAX_PROCESS_TIME=3600 \
-v /mnt/efs:/opt/datalogics/public \
pdf_toolkit_self-hosted_api:latest
```



## Manually Load Balancing AMIs

Follow these instructions to manually set up a Load Balancer and Autoscaling Group for your Self-Hosted API. While we provide instructions for manually setting this up, this is best deployed as part of a CloudFormation stack.

::alert{type="secondary" icon="lucide:info"}
The CloudFormation deployment option automates the provisioning and configuration of all of the following AWS resources. As always, it is highly recommended.
::


1. Create a new AMI Snapshot from the EC2 dashboard.
2. Create a new [Launch Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html).
3. Create a new [Target Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html).
4. Create a new [Autoscaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html).
5. Add an [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html) to your Autoscaling Group.
6. Create new [Listener Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-update-rules.html) on the ALB.
7. Create new [HTTPS Listener Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html) on the ALB.
8. Create new [Security Group Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-update-security-groups.html) to properly secure your ALB.
