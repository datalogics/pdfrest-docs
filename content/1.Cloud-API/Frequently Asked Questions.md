## General API

  #title
  How are API calls measured?
  
  #content
  When you sign up with an account and select a plan, you will receive a unique API Key that will grant you access to send API Calls to any of the pdfRest API Tools. At the start of each calendar month, your total number of API Calls will be tallied for the previous month, and you will be billed for your base plan plus any overage you may have accrued if your monthly API Calls were in excess of your plan's included amount. This count starts over at zero on the first day of each month.\:br\:brpdfRest supports two types of API Calls:
  
  - **POST Requests**: These are used to process files with each of the API Tools
  - **GET Requests**: These are used to retrieve files back from the processing server or poll for request status and response
    :br
    :br
  
  All calls that require your API Key count towards your monthly total, including all POST requests and GET requests sent to the `/request-status` endpoint. GET requests sent to the `/resource` endpoint do not require your API Key or count towards your monthly total.

  What is the File Retention Period?
  
  #content
  File Retention Period refers to the duration for which pdfRest stores the uploaded input files and processed output files after an API call completes. This allows you to access or download the converted documents for a specific period.\:br\:brAfter this amount of time, files are automatically and permanently deleted for your security. We cannot recover files after they are deleted, so be sure to retrieve them after processing completes. Please refer to the [Pricing page](https://pdfrest.com/pricing/) for the file retention period for each Plan. This value can be customized for Enterprise plans.

  How do EU GDPR AP calls work?
  
  #content
  pdfRest offers a dedicated EU GDPR Cloud API for organizations requiring data processing within the European Union to comply with GDPR regulations. Here's how it works::br\:br**Dedicated EU Endpoint**:br
  
  - To ensure your data remains within the EU, you must direct your API requests to our dedicated EU endpoint: `eu-api.pdfrest.com`
  - Requests sent to our standard US endpoint `api.pdfrest.com` will result in data being processed within the United States, which may not meet your GDPR compliance requirements.
  
  **Simple Endpoint Changes**:br
  
  - All of our existing PDF processing tools are available through the EU endpoint.
  - You simply need to change the root URL of your API requests, while keeping the endpoint paths the same.
  - For example, to compress a PDF, use `eu-api.pdfrest.com/compressed-pdf`.
  
  **Data Processing Within the EU**:br
  
  - Using the EU endpoint guarantees that all data uploads, processing, and storage occur exclusively within our secure EU data centers.
  - This ensures adherence to GDPR data protection laws and minimizes the risk of non-compliance.
  
  **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**:br
  
  - We provide a [Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://pdfrest.com/data-processing-agreement/), a legally binding contract outlining our responsibilities and obligations regarding personal data processing.
  - This DPA demonstrates our commitment to GDPR compliance and provides transparency into our data processing practices.
  
  **Plan Level Access and Pricing**:br
  
  - Premium and Pro plans have a fee associated with each call to the EU GDPR Cloud API. There is no fee for Enterprise usage. Please refer to the [Pricing page](https://pdfrest.com/pricing/) for more details.

  What access controls are in place to ensure data privacy and security?
  
  #content
  Role-based access controls ensure that only the access needed to fulfill a particular role is given to an internal employee. There is no usage of third-party entities or contractors.

  :::accordion-item
  #title
  How and with what frequency is customer data backed up?
  
  #content
  All production systems are ephemeral and utilize infrastructure-as-code practices. There is currently no need for backups of our systems.\:br\:brThe duration that customer files are stored depends on the customer's selected plan level. This duration is determined by the "File Persistence" value associated with each plan, which is displayed in detail on the [Pricing page](https://pdfrest.com/pricing/). pdfRest adheres to a file lifecycle policy that automatically deletes files after the designated File Persistence period has elapsed.\:br\:br**No customer data is retained or backed up beyond that File Persistence period.**
