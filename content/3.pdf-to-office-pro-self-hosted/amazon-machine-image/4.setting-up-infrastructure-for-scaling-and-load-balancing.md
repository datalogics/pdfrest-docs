Follow these instructions to **manually** set up autobalanced load scaling infrastructure for use with your self hosted stack. Note that while we provide instructions for manually setting this up, this is best deployed as part of a CloudFormation stack.

Please [contact us](https://pdfrest.com/support/) for assistance or for CloudFormation template examples.

## Steps

1. Create a new AMI Snapshot from the EC2 dashboard.
2. Create a new [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html).
3. Create a new [target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html).
4. Create a new [autoscaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html).
5. Add a [load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html) to your autoscaling group.
6. Create new [listener rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-update-rules.html).
7. Create new [HTTPS listener rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html).
8. Create new [security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-update-security-groups.html).
